## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Hello !, my name is Corteiz Grey. I am a student at Nga Puna O Waiorea or Western Springs College and today i'll be talking a whole lot about myself !
###### My experiences so far in 11TDG KN 2025 has been nothing but great things! Met a lot of cool engaging people who strive to do their best in everything they do
## This README file is basically my biography !, I am of the Maori people, A proud warrior race but that was my ancestors :) In truth
### I love to eat food, listen to music and I especially love my occasional late night strolls. So there is no need to worry about me :)
###### I won't be skewering you or any of the kind rather i'd love to help as much as i can wherever needed.
## My favorite hobby is basketball and my traditional trainings of Kapa Haka
### Ever since I was a kid i loved basketball, Even though Kapa Haka is new to me i found it growing on me quickly :)
##### I have a beautiful family who supports me all the way, I also have great friends here who help me through my hardships.
## I can be a bit on the cheeky side but beneath all the male bravado im a chill guy who likes to relax a lot.
### That was a little bit about me and it would be great to hear from you ( THANK YOU SINCERELY CORTEIZ GREY )
